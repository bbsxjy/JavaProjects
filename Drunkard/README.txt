ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
1. 
Because when Drunkard is finding his path, he can be back and forth so many times. However, it shows on the graphs is like so many dead ends



2.
When dragging or minimizing the window, there will be new output in the console and also a new graph on the window.
This is because, when changing the size of the window, it also change the size which we gave on the program(e.g 400*400 pixels)



3.
I think a better way to solve this: make a fix size of the window or save the graph to a temporary pictures.
